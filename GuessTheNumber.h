Purpose : Guess the number game.
          User will have to guess a number that is randomly generated by the
          computer in the range of 0-20.
          User gets 5 tries and computer will tell if their entered number is 
          too high or too low. If the guess is within the range "number Â± 3"
          then the game will either tell you "Your guess is close but higher."
          or "Your guess is close but lower." based on the conditions at that 
          moment.

Libraries Used : <stdio.h>,  <stdlib.h>,  <time.h>
